# Habit Builder

## About 

Instant gratification helps build a habit. Most habits don't give instant rewards but ticking something off gives a dopamine
hit which act as a proxy reward. It makes you feel good about what you do. This app has counters for each habit and shows your
progress over the weeks and days in charts, which is a really good motivation, in my opinion. 

## How to run

This can be run inside Expo Go app using <a href="exp://exp.host/@sivakar12/habit-builder">this URL</a>
